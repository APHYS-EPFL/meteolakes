  "description": "Meteolakes is an online platform for monitoring and forecasting the bio-physical state of Swiss lakes. The application visualizes the results of 3D hydrodynamic-biological simulations performed daily with the Delft3D modelling framework on a compute server. Additionally, it displays measurements from a field station with data connexion and remote sensing images downloaded from satellites in real-time.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis product is an outcome of Theo Baracchini's PhD thesis, conduced at EPFL in the Physics of Aquatic Systems Laboratory (APHYS) and part of a European Space Agency funded project (CORESIM). A web version is available for desktop computers on http://meteolakes.ch",
