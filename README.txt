2. Go to http://aphys.epfl.ch/page-118054.html
3. Login (bottom right)
4. Enter Preview mode
5. Open the File Manager
6. Browse to aphys/MeteoLac
7. Click "upload"
8. Browse to the "package.zip" file create in step 1
9. Tick "automatically unzip"
10. Click ok and close the file manager
11. Refresh the page

Deployment steps (IIS):

1. Run less_minify_and_pack.bat
2. Remotely connect to aphyspc1.epfl.ch (using e.g. intranet\username creds)
3. Paste the content of the "package.zip" file in "C:\inetpub\wwwroot"
4. Paste "index.html"
5. Paste "index_container.html"

	the index_container.html page which contains the whole body.
index_container.html

models/Particle.js
	UNUSED. Represents a particle moving in a certain direction, associated
