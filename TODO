Recently refactored:

- Created a multi-page structure with single navigation bar
- Integrated graph-view (Buchillon weather station) as page-insitu
- Generalized the previous temperature and velocity controllers into a single "lake-view" component that can display both vector and scalar data
- Added a lake-icon directive to dynamically define georeferenced icons, and moved the transect minimaps to the lake-specific data folder

=> Now it should be easier and involve less code copy-pasting to add new pages such as water quality, and to extend the application to other lakes.

Next refactoring steps:

- Create a time-control component that replaces the TimeCtrl controller and most of page-hydro.template.html. The idea is that
  several <lake-view> elements can be inserted within <time-control></time-control> tags.
  Currently the entire top navigation bar HTML code exists twice (page-hydro and page-quality), which is not nice.

- Integrate graph-ctrl.js in page-insitu-component.js, properly turning that page into a component.
